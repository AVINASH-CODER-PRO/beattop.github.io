#### Video Demo :
#### Description 
My project addresses the issue of people needing to visit multiple places to find statistics or information, such as discovering the top 10 movies, games, or other related rankings. 
For instance, if someone wants to find the top 10 movies, they usually go to IMDb. If they want to know who the richest person is, they might visit Forbes. 
Similarly, gamers might search different platforms to find the best-selling games of all time.

**beattop**, my project, aims to solve this problem by consolidating all these diverse sources of information into one place.

i have combine all these things in one site 
it contains 10 files(6 html,2 css, 2 javascript)
